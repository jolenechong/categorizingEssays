# Multi-Class Text Classification: Categorizing Essays

Problem: ðŸ“š Education Industry, Tuition Centres have a database of past well-written student essays that could be used as reference for future students.

Our objective is to create an AI model to automate the categorization of essays at 75% accuracy for easier retrieval and reference, and ultimately for students to gain access to a wealth of valuable essays.

The AI model utilizes both LDA topic modelling and multi-class text classification techniques.

## How it works

#### Data Scraping
I first scraped 2.5k rows of data per category from GradesFixer's Essay Examples Website. As essays are long, much more time is needded to preprocess the text hence we've decided on a goal of 14k cleaned essays. GradesFixer's Essay Examples

These were the decided categories after looking at websites with essay samples, ensuring distinct categories. I also removed duplicates and essays with multiple overlapping categories before ensuring even distribution among categories.

#### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
To clean the data, we would need to first understand what is needed. So I started with visualizing data to understand columns, null, duplicates and more.

Steps to Data Cleaning
- Handled Nulls (removed), Duplicates (none)
- Language Detection (remove noise of non-english data)
- Did the following on all text columns
- Whitespace Tokenization
- Negation Handling
- Expanded Contractions
- Removing diacritics (there were many in history essays, helps to decrease dimensionality)
- POS Tagging
- Normalized Text (case conversion, strip punctuation, special characters, numbers and stopwords
- Lemmatization with POS Tagging (to optimize)
- Generated Noun-Only and Summary-Only (LSA vs TextRank) datasets to identify main ideas and themes of the essay

Here are 2 of the most interesting insights gained.

Literature, Social Issues and Life Essays tend to have the lowest word count

"People" was one of the highly important repeated words across categories. Other than that, the categories and their top words correspond with each other.

Let's now move on to the modelling process.
