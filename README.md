# Multi-Class Text Classification: Categorizing Essays

Problem: ðŸ“š Education Industry, Tuition Centres have a database of past well-written student essays that could be used as reference for future students.

Our objective is to create an AI model to automate the categorization of essays at 75% accuracy for easier retrieval and reference, and ultimately for students to gain access to a wealth of valuable essays.

The AI model utilizes both LDA topic modelling and multi-class text classification techniques.
